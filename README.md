# GL++

A thin wrapper around OpenGL for C++11.
This library was inspired by [Vulkan.hpp](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Hpp), the C++ wrapper for Vulkan.

## Unique resources

All OpenGL object handles (or ids) are wrapped in a `UniqueXxx` type that handles automatic destruction. These types are similar to a `std::unique_ptr` ; they can't be copied but can be moved.

## check_errors()

`glpp::check_errors()` and `glpp::check_errors_even_in_release()` will detect errors generated by OpenGL (even if you don't have access to the modern debugging feature added in OpenGL 4.3)
```cpp
glUseProgram(0);
glpp::check_errors(); // Will detect that we just tried to use an invalid program id and will call the error callback with an error message of "GL_INVALID_OPERATION"
```

You can provide you own callback that will be called when an error is detected

```cpp
glpp::set_error_callback([](std::string&& error_message) {
    throw std::runtime_error{error_message};
});
```

If you do not provide a callback, by default *glpp* logs to `std::cerr`.
